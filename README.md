## WBUI2 Changelog

### v1.25

- Introduced SpecialTags for enhanced display functionality
  - Replace plain text with a "SpecialTag" to show a special window instead
  - Simply input the SpecialTag â€” additional text will break the functionality
  - Available SpecialTags:
    - `{playerlist}`: Displays a list of currently connected players


### v1.24

- Internal Code Cleanup
- New INI Option Added
  - `ForceLoadSaveGame=True/False`
    - When set to `True`, the mod will load settings from `WBUI2\Config.sav` and automatically set the `Use Ingame Settings` checkbox to `true`
- SaveGame Creation
  - The mod will now create a SaveGame file, located at `\ShooterGame\Saved\SaveGames\WBUI2\Config.sav`
  - You can copy the `WBUI2` folder to another server's `SaveGames` folder to transfer settings
  - Important: The mod will only use the SaveGame file if `ForceLoadSaveGame=True` is set in the `GameUserSettings.ini`
- Options for Making Changes if you have set `ForceLoadSaveGame=True`
  - If you wish to make changes to the settings, choose one of the following methods:
    - Option 1: Use the Ingame Editor to adjust settings directly in-game
    - Option 2: Set `ForceLoadSaveGame=False` in `GameUserSettings.ini` to load settings from the last specified source (either the INI URL, URL from Ingame Settings, or the Ingame Editor)
